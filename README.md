# Natural-language-procesing
This program finds all the nouns presents in a text file and the other prgram deletes the duplicate words present between two text files.
Run noun.py to extract all the nouns present in a text file.
Run duplicatedelete.py to delete all the common words present between two text files.
I've added two text files for example.
